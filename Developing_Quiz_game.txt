- Developing Quiz game
	- Divided into Django backend and React frontend

- Django Backend 
	- Setup the application
	- install requirements
	- setup git repository 
	- Start development 

-- Setup Django application 
	- installing Django on global python environment using command pip install django  ---- ON time on a machine
	- start a project - django-admin startproject <PROJECT NAME>
	- Setting up the virtual environment for the project
	- installing Django again in the environment using pip install Django

-- Before moving with the installation of the application, we must look after the two famous ways of developing APIs 
	- Using basic Django to develop routes for and return json response instead of html response
	- Using a more standard way by using a framework of Django i.e. djangorestframework, which provided all the amenities required for developing APIs and developing more scalable and manageable application


-- We decided to go with djangorestframework
-- We are not planning to use any user login and signup

-- Installation 
	-- install djangorestframework using command pip install djangorestframework

-- Start creating apps into the Django application 
	- Use command python manage.py startapp <APP_NAME>
